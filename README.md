# onoff
MATLAB code for predicting the ON and OFF pathway responses to visual input

Main function is onoff.m:


Predict the ON and OFF retinal ganglion cell responses to an image.
Separate predictions are generated for foveal and peripheral cells in the
P and M pathways

Example call: [on, off, rgcs] = onoff('file','checker.png','arcminperpixel',1)

INPUT: If called with no arguments, you will be prompted to select an image
file and the image viewing resolution will be assumed to be 1 arcminute
per pixel.

      If the 'file' argument is supplied, it will instead try to load that 
      file from the current working directory       

      If the 'arcminperpixel' argument is supplied, it will use that value
      instead of the default for the visual arcminutes subtended by a single
      image pixel


Note that image element values are assumed to be linear with world light
intensity. This means that loading an image file directly from a camera
will likely produce spurious predictions due to nonlinearities introduced in
the image encoding. Loading a bitmap that has been designed for display
on a linearized monitor via a LUT, however, should produce meaningful 
predictions. File types can be anything that MATLAB's imread can handle, 
as well as .mat files containing a single variable that is a matrix
containing the image. Images of matrices containing 3 channels will be
assumed to be RGB and a luminance conversion will be applied.

For convenience, the auxillary load_images function can handle images that 
come from the Van Hateren Natural Image Dataset
(http://bethgelab.org/datasets/vanhateren/)

or from the McGill Calibrated Colour Image Database
(http://tabby.vision.mcgill.ca)

...so long as the file ending is ".iml" for Van Hateren or the file/path 
contains the phrase "mcg" for McGill (and the McGill rgb2linear function
is also in the path)

Otherwise, various example images are provided in example_images
directory for testing


OUTPUT: 

      on, off:    structures that contain matrices of the ON and OFF
                  response magnitudes at each input image pixel. Matrixes are cropped
                  relative to the input image to remove boundary artifacts from
                  convolution

      rgcs:       structure with info about the rgc model used to produce each
                  matrix in the on and off structures

Also produces plots illustrating the RGC models used, images of the
RGC response magnitudes for P and M pathways, and a bar plot of the summed 
responses for ON and OFF cells in each population (4 populations total)
